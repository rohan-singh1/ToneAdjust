# Tone Adjust

This is a command line Python program which allows a user to adjust the bass, treble, mid and volume of a WAV file by implementing high-pass, low-pass and band-pass filters.

This program uses the **SciPy** and **NumPy** for sound data manipulation and _libtone_ library from [hw-tone-resources](https://github.com/pdx-cs-sound/hw-tone-resources) by Bart Massey for reading from and writing to a WAV file, parsing command line arguments and playback of WAV files.
